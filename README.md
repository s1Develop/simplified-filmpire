## This is a simplified version of Filmpire, a movie search application built using React. The application allows users to search for movies and displays the results in a visually appealing manner. The code uses React hooks such as useState and useEffect to manage the state of the application and to fetch data from an external API. The MovieCard component is used to display information about each movie, including its title, year of release, poster, and type. This project demonstrates the use of React hooks and props to build a dynamic and interactive user interface.

## By working on this project, I have learned how to use useState to manage the state of my application, useEffect to fetch data from an external API, and how to pass data between components using props.
